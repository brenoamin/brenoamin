# Hey — I'm Breno 👋

Computer Engineer working as a Software Engineer with 3.5+ years of experience building scalable backend systems using Golang and Ruby.
I care about reliability, performance, and delivering solutions that move business metrics — not just code.

I've worked on platforms serving millions of users, reduced operational costs by more than 90%, cut processes from days to seconds, and helped teams move faster through automation and strong engineering decisions.

Focused on backend architecture, distributed systems and software design — clean, scalable and built to last.
